# Intro-Java
This is a collection of **_sample tutorial program codes_** and **_exercises_** to explain and demostrate the various features of the Java programming language.

## Topics Covered
### 1. Java Introduction.

Java is a **_statically-typed_** programming language, so it expects its **_variables_** to be declared before they can be assigned values. 

> A variable is a named memory (RAM) location to hold data. Each variable has a specific **_data type_** and should be given an **_identifier_** (unique name). 

The **_data type_** specifies the type of data that can be stored in the variable. It also determines the range of values that can be stored within that memory location; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

### 2. Java Control Flow Statements.
Java code is generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. However, **_control flow statements_** change up the flow of execution by employing **_decision making, looping, and branching_**, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

#### 2.1. if statements.
- `if` statement.
- `if-else` statement.
- `if-else-if` statement.
- Nested `if` or `if-else` statement.
#### 2.2. switch.
The `switch` statement allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives.
#### 2.3. for loop and for-each loop.
#### 2.4. while loop.
#### 2.5. do-while loop.
#### 2.6. branching statements.
- `break`, `continue` and `return`.

------
### 3. Java Arrays.
#### 3.1. One-dimensional Array.
#### 3.2. Multi-dimensional Array.

------
### 4. Java Collections Interface.
#### 4.1. List Interface.
- `ArrayList`.
- `LinkedList`.
- `Stack`.
- `Vector`.
#### 4.2. Queue Interface.
- `PriorityQueue`.
- `LinkedList`.
- `Deque`.
#### 4.3. Set Interface.
- `HashSet`.
- `TreeSet`.
- `LinkedHashSet`.
